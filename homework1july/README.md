This Java program swaps every pair of adjacent elements in an integer array.
For example:

Input: { 3, 2, 1, 6, 3, 5, 8, 9, 0, 4 }

Output: { 2, 3, 6, 1, 5, 3, 9, 8, 4, 0 }

âœ… How It Works

1. The program initializes an integer array with 10 elements.
2. It loops through the array in steps of 2, swapping each pair:
3. It uses a temporary variable temp to swap arr[i] with arr[i+1].
4. Finally, it prints the updated array to the console.
